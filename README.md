The Bitcoin CSV used in the notebook is sourced from [this Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) on  Bitcoin data at 1-min intervals from select exchanges, Jan 2012 to August 2019. Please be sure to download the data and use that for this notebook, as the data files are too large for GitHub.
